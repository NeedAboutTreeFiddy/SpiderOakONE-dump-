I got the same problem when the "Windows Feature" update was installed a few days ago. I got it to work by setting the Compatibility to "Windows 8". A number of users have reported that there are two EOS Utility programs. The first is in C:\Program Files(x86)\EOS Utility. The second is in C:\Program Files(x86)\EOS Utility\EOS Utility.

The first doesn't run at all after the update. Doesn't show up in Task Manager at all. The second run can be made to run (change the pointer in Start Menu or your shortcut), but comes up with "Download Photos" greyed out.

You have to set the Compatibility Setting on the first program and let it call the second one for you. Then the program will run as normal.

Only took me about 8 hours of reading various forums to figure this out.
